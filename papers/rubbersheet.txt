The Rubber Sheet model maps the coordinates of each Cartesian point from the segmented iris region to polar coordinates (r,θ) where r ranges from 0 to 1 and θ ranges  
from 0 2π. In diﬀerent eye images from the same subject, changes in the iris pattern occur due
to pupil dilation or constriction. The conversion to a dimensionless form also ensures
the iris pattern is not inﬂuenced by magniﬁcation and image distance acquisition factors.
John Daugman’s rubber sheet model ensures the proper handling of the matter due to
the speciﬁcs of the iris. It accounts size inconsistencies and pupil dilation, but does not
compensate for rotational inconsistencies [15]. These can be eliminated at the matching
stage with simple bit-shifting of the encoded iris template.
The points between the inner and outer iris boundaries are interpolated
linearly by a homogeneous rubber sheet model, which automatically reverses
the iris pattern deformations caused by pupillary dilation or constriction. Un-
der assumptions of uniform iris elasticity (which may be questionable), this
normalization maps the iris tissue into a doubly-dimensionless coordinate sys-
tem. The homogeneous rubber sheet model assigns to each point in the iris,
regardless of iris size in the image and of pupillary dilation, a pair of dimen-
sionless real coordinates r,θwhere rlies in the unit interval [0,1] and θis the
angular variable, cyclic over [0 : 2π].
